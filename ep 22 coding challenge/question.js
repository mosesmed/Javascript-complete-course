1. Three girls from different schools Renny, Damico, Modakeke competed in a math competition. Each students is graded based on three challenges. A winner is chosen based on the highest average score of all three challenges. Below are the three results of each school
Renny: 50, 81, 63
Damico: 49, 83, 60
Modakeke: 48, 73, 75

a. Create an arrow function to calculate the average of any three numbers
b. Use the function to calculate the average score of each school
c. Create another function that checks for winner based on the average scores

2. A VAT calculator collects 20% on cost from 1 to 50 and 10% on cost from 51 and above. Based on these three cost values ( 43, 75, 50) perform the operations below

a. create a function that calculates the VAT of any cost value
b. Use the function to calc VAT of the cost values above and put the VAT in an array and output to the console
c. Based on the VAT value, compute the total value of each cost + VAT, save it in an array and output the result to console

3. John and James are two friends who are happy about getting their drivers license. John's birth year is 1998 while that of James is  2008. If the current year is 2019. Perform the operation below based on the data provided

a. create an object for each of them containing their name, birth year, age
b. with the result of their profile, create a function to determine the eligibility of getting a driver license if the minimum age requirement is 18
c. based on the eligibility function, check if John and James are eligible for license

4. Using the the test data from question two perform the operation below

a. create a function that calculates the VAT of all three values and save the result in an array
b. modify the function to also calculate the total value of the cost which is VAT + Initial cost and input the result into an array for all the three values.
